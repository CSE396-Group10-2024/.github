Patient Assistance and Entertainment System (PAES)
Introduction

The Patient Assistance and Entertainment System (PAES) is designed to improve the quality of life for patients and caregivers in healthcare settings. PAES integrates various modules to enhance patient-caregiver communication and provide a comprehensive solution for patient care and entertainment.
Modules

The PAES project consists of several modules, each with a specific purpose:
1. PAES-SOFTWARE-VIDEOSTREAMING

This module sets up a video streaming server that captures video frames from a local camera and sends them to a connected client over a network.
2. PAES-SOFTWARE-SHAPEDETECTION

This module uses OpenCV to detect and classify shapes in an image, supporting lines, triangles, rectangles, squares, pentagons, and circles.
3. PAES-HARDWARE-AIRMOUSE

This module implements a Bluetooth air mouse using an ESP32 microcontroller and an IMU sensor to translate motion into mouse movements and buttons for mouse clicks.
4. Caregiver Application

A mobile app designed to streamline the process of tracking patient needs, assigning physical therapy programs, and monitoring patient progress.
Project Overview

PAES provides innovative solutions in healthcare and technology by offering a system that makes patient care more effective and enjoyable. Our mission is to create better communication between patients and caregivers, identify and meet patients’ needs quickly and accurately, and improve patients’ overall health and morale through physical exercises and fun activities.
